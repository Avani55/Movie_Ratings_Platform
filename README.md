# Movie_Ratings_Platform
________________________________________
Description-
The Movie Ratings Platform is a console-based Java application that allows users to browse, rate, and manage a collection of movies. The project extensively utilizes the Java Collection Framework, specifically an ArrayList, to store and manage movie data. Users can interactively update movie ratings and view a dynamically updated list of movies.
Features
•	Preloaded Movie Database: The platform comes with a collection of popular movies preloaded into the system.
•	Interactive Rating System: Users can select a movie and update its rating in real time.
•	Dynamic Updates: The movie list reflects updated ratings immediately after changes are made.
•	Search and Management: The ArrayList implementation allows efficient management of movies, including adding, retrieving, and updating movie details.
Technology Stack
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java Collection Framework
•	Data Structure: ArrayList for dynamic storage and manipulation of movies
Highlights
•	Encapsulation: Fields in the Movies class are private, with public getters and setters for controlled access.
•	Custom Constructors: Includes both parameterized and copy constructors for flexible object creation.
•	String Formatting: Overridden toString method for consistent and readable output formatting.
•	Robust Error Handling: Ensures user inputs (like index selection) are validated to prevent runtime errors.
How It Works
1.	The application initializes with a predefined list of movies stored in an ArrayList.
2.	Users can view the movies along with their ratings and formats (e.g., BluRay or DVD).
3.	By selecting a movie via its index, users can update its rating.
4.	The updated movie list is displayed after each change, offering an interactive experience.
5.	Users can continue updating ratings or exit the application.
